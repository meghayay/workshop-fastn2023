- Now you have VSCode on the web to work on this repo üéâ

- Go to `FASTN.ftd` file

  This file is the package manager, if you gave the repo name anything other than `workshop-fastn-sep-2023` please update all the times `workshop-fastn-sep-2023` is written to your repository's name for it to work!

  Also update `<repo_owner>` with your GitHub username

- Open the terminal (`CTRL` + `\``) and run:

  ```bash
  bash
  source <(curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh) # installs fastn on the codespace
  fastn serve # this will start the fastn server which you can view with the link provided
  ```

- Go to `index.ftd` file

  This file has the code for the website, it has two sections, one is the mobile view (L26-89):

  https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/workshop-fastn-sep-2023/blob/main/index.ftd#L26-L89

  The other section is for desktop (L103-157):

  https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/workshop-fastn-sep-2023/blob/main/index.ftd#L103-L157

- Have a look around the code, try to change the texts and links to make them all yours ‚ú®

- Look at the running version of fastn server and see how it looks ü§ì

- Now have a look at `components/button.ftd`!

  Yes, this is how easy it is to add components in FASTN!

- Finally, update the `image/favicon.ico` to be a icon of your liking (on vscode for web you can drag and drop the *.ico* file here and rename it! There are several png or jpg to ico convertors on the internet if you need one!)

- Boom! üî• you made your very own fastn website

- Now open the terminal again, click on the plus icon (top right of the terminal) to create a new instance

- Run the following commands to commit your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "my small mini link in bio"
  git push
  ```

- Now go back to your GitHub Repository, on the settings tab, then the `pages` button on the menu

  ![](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/workshop-fastn-sep-2023/assets/135469703/8a123c6a-a71c-4d97-83cc-6825a39dc3b1)

- Now open the select option for the branch and select `gh-pages`

  ![](https://github.com/xkrishguptaa/workshop-fastn-sep-2023/assets/135469703/ac88830a-1986-4dd9-ad20-0953b1e4ac56)

- Save and you are done! Your website will soon be live at `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/workshop-fastn-sep-2023`
